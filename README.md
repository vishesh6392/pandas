# Pandas Learning Project

## Introductory Overview
Pandas is a powerful and flexible open-source data analysis and manipulation tool built on top of the Python programming language. It is widely used for data wrangling, data cleaning, and data analysis, making it an essential library for data science and analytics.

## Setup Instructions
To get started with pandas, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Install Python (if you haven't already) from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Install pandas using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

## Basic Usage Examples
Here are some simple examples to help you get started with pandas:

### Example 1: Creating a DataFrame
```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

### Example 2: Reading a CSV File
```python
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(df.head())
```

### Example 3: Data Analysis
```python
# Calculate the mean age
mean_age = df['Age'].mean()
print('Mean Age:', mean_age)
```

## Project Details
This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for beginners who want to understand how to use pandas for data analysis. Feel free to explore the examples and modify the code to see how it works!
